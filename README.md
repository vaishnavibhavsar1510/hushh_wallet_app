Day 1:Total 2 Bugs reported- 
**First bug :**
1. I downloaded the app through the provided correct link. Later when I click on the login option it does not direct me to next page as it should.
2. Instead it just keeps showing a loading icon on the login pink button.
3. I would have provided a screenshot or a screen recording of the same in this same google form if there was a option here itself instead.

**Second Bug:**
1. During the sign-up process on Hushh website/application, the input boxes for user details (such as name, email, datw of birth, etc.) are not evenly spaced. The gaps between these input fields vary, creating an inconsistent and unprofessional appearance.

Day 2:

**Third Bug **
Bug Reported: Issues with Audio Card Addition, Contact Display, and Permission Updates
The audio card was not initially added and reset after the first button press, but it succeeded on the second attempt. The message indicated that Google has not verified the app in Receipt Radar. Contacts are not appearing in the Hush chat of the card. When we upload our asset using another option, it does not display in the app. We are unable to update the card's minimum bid on Hush card, but it does update on the card I created. We cannot update the access permissions from the permission menu, and sometimes it opens the phone's permission inbox instead.

**Fourth Bug**
**For Browser Companion Extension** :The issue occurs inconsistently when hovering over purchases, where the "Add to wishlist" option sometimes appears and sometimes does not. This variability suggests a potential bug or inconsistency in the system's behavior. It could be related to specific product categories, purchase history, or possibly a glitch in how the wishlist feature is integrated or enabled for certain items. Further investigation would be needed to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the "Add to wishlist" option fails to appear consistently for some purchases but not others.


**Day 3: **
Bug in Browser Companion Extension:
Expected Behavior:

The signup page should have a password field with an icon (usually an eye) that allows you to toggle the visibility of the characters you're typing. When you click the icon:
If the password is currently hidden (represented by dots or asterisks), clicking the icon should reveal the actual characters you typed.

Actual Behavior:
There seems to be a bug with the password visibility toggle on the signup page. Here's how it deviates from the expected behavior:
Clicking the icon doesn't not have any effect at all. The password remains hidden regardless of the button's state.
