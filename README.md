**Hushh App link: ** https://bit.ly/hushh-wallet-228
Day 1:Total 2 Bugs reported- 
**First bug :**
1. I downloaded the app through the provided correct link. Later when I click on the login option it does not direct me to next page as it should.
2. Instead it just keeps showing a loading icon on the login pink button.
3. I would have provided a screenshot or a screen recording of the same in this same google form if there was a option here itself instead.

**Second Bug:**
1. During the sign-up process on Hushh website/application, the input boxes for user details (such as name, email, datw of birth, etc.) are not evenly spaced. The gaps between these input fields vary, creating an inconsistent and unprofessional appearance.
